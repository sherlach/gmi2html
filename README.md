This program converts gemtext formatted documents (.gmi) to html.

It is a fork of Henry Precheur's program of the same name. 
(git.sr.ht/~henryprecheur/gmi2html)

I have added support for additional aspects of gemtext such as quoting,
lists, and headings. Style has been stolen from the best motherf$%@ing 
website. I'm not going to add a link - if you know, you know.

(Work in Progress)


TODO

- Refactoring desperately needed, os. module sometimes used, Printf sometimes used, for example. TrimPrefix instead of TrimLeft
- Heading "Doctype html" et cetera
- Similarly, Style from the BMW
- Headings
- Quotes
